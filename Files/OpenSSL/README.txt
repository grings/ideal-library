Those are the files that I used with IdHttp on Windows32 and 64, Android32 and 64 and iOS64.
Currently I'm using 1.0.2u on Android, and 1.0.2g on Windows and iOS

Couldn't find the U version for iOS, glad if you help!!!

The U version I took from https://projetoacbr.com.br/
The G version I took from https://indy.fulgan.com/SSL/
I don't remember exactly where I took the iOS files from G version
